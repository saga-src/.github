### **Our Philosophy**

1. **Local-First:** Your imagination and your history belong to you. We prioritize OPFS and SQLite storage.
2. **Offline-Capable:** Creativity and play shouldn't depend on an internet connection.
3. **Beautifully Structured:** We believe complex data (narratives and statistics) deserves a polished, distraction-free interface.
